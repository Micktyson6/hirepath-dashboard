Overview
This project is a modern, end‑to‑end solution for managing candidates, roles, interviews, and related hiring data. It combines a responsive React UI with a robust Express API. The backend uses Drizzle ORM to talk to PostgreSQL in a type-safe way, minimizing boilerplate and improving developer experience. The frontend uses Tailwind CSS to deliver a clean, professional look that scales from small screens to large displays. The dashboard is designed to support HR teams, recruiters, and talent operations, enabling them to:
- Create, read, update, and delete candidate records
- Manage job postings and applications
- Schedule and track interviews
- Run bulk actions to move many items at once
- Archive items for long‑term retention
- See at‑a‑glance statistics and trends

Why HirePath Dashboard matters
In modern recruiting, teams juggle dozens or hundreds of candidates, job postings, interview feedback, and status changes every day. A dedicated dashboard helps teams stay organized, reduces manual work, and speeds up decision making. By using a strong tech stack—React for a fluid user interface, Express for a lightweight API, Drizzle ORM for safe database interactions, PostgreSQL for reliable storage, and Tailwind CSS for a modern UI—the project supports quick iteration, clear data modeling, and consistent visuals. Deployment on Render ensures that the app is accessible, scalable, and maintainable without complex server setup.

Tech stack and architecture
- Frontend: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, modern tooling (Vite or equivalent), accessible UI components
- Backend: Express.js server with REST-like endpoints, TypeScript, authentication scaffolding
- ORM: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL, enabling type-safe queries and migrations
- Database: PostgreSQL for reliable relational data storage and SQL features
- Deployment: Render, with static hosting for the frontend and a backend service for the API
- Development workflow: Local development with npm/yarn/pnpm scripts, Docker options, and test coverage
- Styling and UI: Tailwind CSS to deliver a consistent aesthetic across screens and devices
- Documentation and testing: Inline types, API documentation, and unit/integration tests as applicable

How the pieces fit together
- The client (frontend) talks to the server (backend) through defined API routes. The backend uses Drizzle ORM to interact with PostgreSQL, performing operations such as creating a candidate, updating a job posting, or querying statistics. The UI presents these results, supports filters and bulk actions, and provides a pleasant workflow for recruiters.
- The data model is designed to reflect hiring workflows, with entities for Candidate, Job, Application, and Interview. Relationships are expressed via foreign keys, which Drizzle ORM maps to TypeScript types for compile-time safety.
- The UI is responsive and accessible, with keyboard navigation, readable contrast, and responsive layout changes that preserve usability across devices.

Data model and schema
The data model emphasizes a clean, extensible design. Key entities are described below with representative fields. This gives a mental model for future additions and migrations.

- Candidate
  - id: unique identifier
  - firstName, lastName, email, phone
  - resumeLink or resumeMetadata (optional)
  - currentStatus (e.g., new, contacted, shortlisted, rejected, hired)
  - archived (boolean)
  - createdAt, updatedAt

- Job
  - id
  - title
  - department
  - location
  - employmentType (full-time, part-time, contract)
  - salaryRange or salaryBand (optional)
  - postedDate
  - archived (boolean)
  - createdAt, updatedAt

- Application
  - id
  - candidateId (FK to Candidate)
  - jobId (FK to Job)
  - status (applied, in-review, contacted, offered, closed)
  - currentStage (screening, interview, negotiation)
  - notes (text)
  - createdAt, updatedAt

- Interview
  - id
  - applicationId (FK to Application)
  - date
  - interviewer
  - feedback
  - outcome (pass/fail)
  - createdAt, updatedAt

- Archive
  - id
  - type (candidate, job, application)
  - itemId
  - archivedAt
  - reason (optional)

Tables and relationships
- Candidates relate to one or more Applications, which relate to Jobs.
- Interviews tie to Applications and carry feedback for decision making.
- Archiving separates items from the active workspace while preserving history.
- Drizzle ORM models encapsulate these relations and provide migrations designed to be incremental and safe.

Getting started locally
This project is designed to be approachable for developers who want to run the stack on their own machines. The steps below outline a typical setup on a Unix-like environment. Adjust paths and commands if you’re on Windows or you use a different shell.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or newer recommended)
- npm or pnpm or yarn (choose your package manager and use it consistently)
- PostgreSQL (14 or newer) or a containerized database
- Git for cloning the repository

Step-by-step setup
- Clone the repository
  - git clone https://github.com/Micktyson6/hirepath-dashboard.git
  - cd hirepath-dashboard

- Install dependencies
  - If the project uses a monorepo or separate client/server folders, install in each part:
    - npm install
    - or pnpm install
    - or yarn install

- Environment configuration
  - Create a local environment file for the backend. A typical pattern is to place a .env file in the server directory with keys such as:
    - DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/hirepath
    - PORT=3001
    - JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
  - If your setup uses a separate frontend server, you might have another .env or configuration file for the client:
    - REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

- Database setup
  - Start PostgreSQL on your machine or in a container.
  - Create the database matching your DATABASE_URL or your configured name.
  - Run migrations to create the initial schema. The exact commands depend on how Drizzle ORM is wired into your project, which may look like:
    - npx drizzle-kit generate
    - npx drizzle-kit push
  - Seed data if your project includes seeds to provide a meaningful local dataset.

- Run the backend
  - Navigate to the backend directory (if separate)
  - Run:
    - npm run dev
  - This starts the Express server, typically on port 3001 or the port defined in your environment.

- Run the frontend
  - In the frontend directory (or in a top-level script if a unified setup exists)
  - Run:
    - npm run start
  - This starts the React development server, typically on port 5173 or 3000, depending on your configuration.

- Verify the app
  - Open the browser to your local frontend URL, usually http://localhost:5173
  - You should see the dashboard UI, with data fetched from the backend.

- Common adjustments
  - If the API URL differs between environments, adjust the frontend config accordingly.
  - If migrations fail, re-run the migration step after confirming the database state.
  - If you see CORS or network errors, ensure the server is accepting requests from the frontend origin.

Running the app
- Local development flow
  - Start the backend API first so the frontend has a live data source to talk to.
  - Then start the frontend UI.
  - As you modify the code, hot reloading will reflect changes in both client and server (where supported).

- Dockerizing for local runs
  - A docker-compose setup can simplify local runs. A typical compose file includes:
    - A PostgreSQL service
    - A backend service (Express)
    - A frontend service (React)
  - Use:
    - docker-compose up -d
  - Then access the app through the frontend container’s port as configured in the compose file.

- Data seeding
  - If you need sample data for testing or demonstration, run the seeding scripts after migrations. The scripts usually populate a few candidates, jobs, and applications to help you explore the UI.

- Debugging tips
  - Check server logs for API errors.
  - Confirm database connectivity by trying simple queries through the ORM layer.
  - If UI components fail to render or data is missing, inspect network requests in the browser’s developer tools to confirm the API endpoints and payloads.

Running on Render or other hosting
- Render deployment patterns
  - Deploy a frontend service to handle the client assets.
  - Deploy a backend service for the API, with separate environment variables for database and API keys.
  - Set up a PostgreSQL instance in Render if you don’t use an external DB.
  - Link the backend service to the database by providing the database URL in the environment variables (DATABASE_URL or similar).
- Webhooks and build pipelines
  - Configure webhooks so that pushes to main refresh builds automatically.
  - Use build hooks or deploy hooks to ensure assets are up to date after code changes.

Deployment considerations and best practices
- Environment separation
  - Keep production and development configs separate. Use environment variables to switch between them.
- Security
  - Protect sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials. Do not commit .env files.
  - Use strong secrets and rotate them periodically.
  - Consider enabling TLS termination at the edge or via the hosting platform.
- Performance
  - Use pagination or lazy loading for large lists to keep the UI responsive.
  - Cache frequent read queries if the workload is heavy.
- Accessibility
  - Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive components.
  - Use semantic HTML with ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- Observability
  - Instrument basic logging on the backend for requests, errors, and performance metrics.
  - Consider adding simple metrics dashboards for response times and error rates.

Data flow and integration points
- Client -> API
  - The client sends requests to the backend to retrieve and modify data.
  - Responses include data payloads and status information that drive UI updates.
- Server -> DB
  - The server uses Drizzle ORM to translate requests into SQL and manage transactions.
  - Migrations ensure the database schema stays in sync with the TypeScript model definitions.
- State management
  - The frontend maintains UI state for filters, sorts, and selected items.
  - When a user performs an action, the UI optimistically updates the local state, then reconciles with the server response to confirm correctness.

Package layout and scripts
- Frontend
  - A typical frontend folder includes:
    - src/ containing components, hooks, and pages
    - index.tsx or main.tsx as the entry point
    - App.tsx with router and layout
    - tailwind.config.js for styling
  - Scripts commonly found in package.json:
    - dev or start for local development
    - build for production
    - lint for code quality
- Backend
  - A typical backend folder includes:
    - src/ containing controllers, routes, and models
    - server.ts or app.ts as the main entry
    - drizzle/ for ORM setup and migrations
  - Scripts commonly found in package.json:
    - dev for local development with nodemon or ts-node
    - start for production
    - migrate for running ORM migrations
- Monorepo considerations
  - If the repo is a monorepo, there could be shared tooling between client and server, with a root package.json containing common scripts and a root tsconfig for type sharing.
